### Application Idea:
Web application which allows to connect users and vendors. If user has any problem in his house or he needs to do some work he can go to the site, find vendors and delegate them his tasks. User can order housework, buildings, facilities etc. User can also find some masters like barbers, doctors, psychologist and comes to their office. At the time vendor can share their skills, be assigned to some companies, provide their services.
